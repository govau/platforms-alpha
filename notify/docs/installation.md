## Installing client libraries

Install the client libraries in your choice of programming language

```filetabs
file=docs/installation/get_python.sh lang=shell label=Python
file=docs/installation/get_java_gradle.md lang=groovy label=Java-Gradle
file=docs/installation/get_java_maven.md lang=groovy label=Java-Maven
```

## Unsupported languages

We detail how to roll-your-own client in the [Getting
started](getting-started.md) section. Together with the `cURL` examples on
any given page, you should be able to build up a client on your own by
accessing the REST API directly.
