## Introduction

**Note: this is the first version.**

The Digital Transformation Agency (DTA), in collaboration with other government
agencies and key private sector bodies, is leading the development of a national
federated digital identity system (the ‘identity federation’). Implementation and
operation of the identity federation is underpinned by the Trusted Digital Identity
Framework (TDIF). This document provides a high-level overview of the TDIF
including its scope and objectives, the relationship between its various documents
and the definition of key terms.
The intended audience for this document includes:

- Accredited Providers.
- Applicants.
- Authorised Assessors.
- Relying Parties.
- Trust Framework Accreditation Authority.

## Context

The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL1
) has
defined an identity system as follows:
“Identity system” means an online environment for identity management transactions
governed by a set of system rules (also referred to as a trust framework) where
individuals, organizations, services, and devices can trust each other because
authoritative sources establish and authenticate their identities. An identity system
involves:

- A set of rules, methods, procedures and routines, technology, standards, policies
  and processes.
- Applicable to a group of participating entities.
- Governing the collection, verification, storage, exchange, authentication and
  reliance on identity attribute information about an individual person, legal entity,
  device or digital object.
- For the purpose of facilitating identity transactions.

Identity systems can be broadly characterised as either “Syndicated” or “Federated”.
Under a syndicated system a single identity credential is issued, typically by
government, to provide single sign-on access to public and private sector services. A
federated system is a decentralised model enabling individuals to access public and
private sector services through a choice of identity providers.

Traditional identity systems have often been based on a collection of bilateral
agreements or loosely-coupled Service Level Agreements (SLAs). These frequently
lack transparency and do not readily scale on a national basis. In contrast, a trust
framework provides an efficient and scalable approach that readily facilitates the
operation of a federated identity system.

A “trust framework” describes a legally binding and agreed set of specifications, rules,
and agreements for the governance of a federated identity system established to
achieve common outcomes among participants. Examples of federated identity
systems that employ trust frameworks include electronic bill payment systems (such as BPAY or Post bill pay), electronic point of sale systems (such as EFTPOS) and
credit card systems (such as MasterCard or Visa). Although these systems are
functionally different, participants that operate within these environments share
common characteristics, including the need for, and assurance that, other participants
within the federated identity system follow the rules applicable to their role. A trust
framework therefore enables participants to have confidence in the functionality and
trustworthiness of federated identity systems.

## Characteristics of a trust framework

The OIX2 defines a trust framework as having the following characteristics:

**Scope:** a trust framework governs a specific federated identity system to enable the
digital verification of an individual’s identity, the binding of individuals to authentication
credentials and the reuse of those credentials to access relying party’s services.

**Purpose:** to define and govern the operation of a federated identity system and the
obligations of its participants in order to ensure both the **functionality** and **trustworthiness** of the system. From a trustworthiness perspective a trust framework
addresses:

- Functionality: the trust framework facilitates the functionality of the federated
  identity system it governs through the use of specifications, rules, and
  agreements designed to ensure that it operates properly in two respects:
  - Proper operation: it governs the federated identity system in a manner
    designed to ensure that the system functions properly for its intended
    purpose (so that it works).
  - Compliance: it is also designed to ensure that the system and its participants
    operate in accordance with legislative and regulatory requirements.
- Trustworthiness: the trust framework facilitates the trustworthiness of the
  federated identity system it governs through the use of specifications, rules, and
  agreements designed to ensure that it functions in a way that is sufficiently
  trustworthy to meet the needs of the participants (so the various parties are
  willing to participate). To that end:
  - Risk Management: it addresses and manages the various risks inherent in
    participating in the identity federation, and the requirements designed to
    address those risks.
  - Legal Certainty and Predictability: the legal rights, responsibilities, and
    liabilities of the participants, within broader legislative and regulatory
    requirements.
  - Transparency: the trust framework specifications, rules, and agreements are
    accessible to and agreed by all participants.
